Blog-Interior-Design

This project is made for "JS Fundamentals cours" - Telecom Academy.
I focused on:
- HTML (create structure with difrent tags, link css file, link script js file, modify a tag structure using JS, create a new tag using JS, using diffrent images, create a nav barr,
create footer, create a counter, input tabs, form tab, textare, order and unorder lists)
- Java Scripts (variables, functions, querySelector, addEventListener, innerHTML, appendChild, createElement );
- CSS concepts (applaying style at general level, at class level, at id level, display flex, dispaly grip, border, size, color, background, import font family).

The result is a beautiful blog for interior design. 
It can be improved at styling by using SASS and on responsivness by using @media.
For me the project was an unique occasion for understanding HTML, CSS at basic level. I worked a lot and maybe to hard but in this way I built my fundation for understanding 
more complex notions as: Bootstrap, SASS.
